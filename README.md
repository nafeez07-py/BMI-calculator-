The BMI Calculator is a Python-based application created under the OIBSIP internship program at Oasis Infobyte. It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight and categorizes the result into health ranges such as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. This project emphasizes logical calculations, user input validation, and basic health-related computations using Python.
